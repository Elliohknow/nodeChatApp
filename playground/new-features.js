// 1. Make usernames unique
// 2. Case INsensitive chat room names, 
	// e.g. users who try to join either the "LOTR"
	// room or the "lotr" room would both end up in 
	// the same room.  
// 3. Add list of currently active chat rooms, in a 
// select-dropdown, could populate the same way the 
// people's list populates. Then instead of typing in 
// a name, one could just select the chat room they
// want to join.
